# Martian Robots Code Test

## Overview

I am using React, Mocha and Chai plus Istanbul for test coverage. I took the route of focusing on testing, rather than on the user interface. There are 23 passing tests with 100% coverage on the Robot constructor class.

This code challenge was really enjoyable. I spent just over 3 hours on my solution.

I've kept my pseudocode inside the `planning.txt` so you can see how I broke down the problem.

## Instructions

```
// install dependencies
yarn install

// start server
yarn start

// run tests
yarn test

```
